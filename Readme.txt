This plugin is based on peregrine's ExtraPage plugin, thanks to peregrine for all his work.

Games is an extra page to put games of all kinds in there. I included a few for you to try and see how they are embedded. To change the games just paste the embed code to the game or change the source url in the existing code.

After you install make sure you enable the plugin in the dashboard.

The file to edit is called games.php
and for extra css edits games.css
